/**
 * This activator is used to initialize and terminate the connection pool to one or more providers.
 * <p>
 * The CDP abstraction layer supports multiple types of providers, with each provider supporting multiple tenants. The
 * "connection" to a specific tenant on a specific provider is represented by a "context" object. These context objects
 * are authenticated to a specific tenant on the provider, but can be reused from one request to another. Contexts are
 * slow to set up and are resource intensive, so they are cached. However, the contexts for a specific tenant on a
 * specific provider must be cached separately.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Activation of the bundle creates an empty cache which is organized first by provider type, then by tenant name, with
 * the contents being an empty pool of contexts for that provider/tenant combination. The pool is created on first use,
 * and retained for as long as the bundle is active.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When the bundle is deactivated, the cache is torn down with all contexts being closed.
