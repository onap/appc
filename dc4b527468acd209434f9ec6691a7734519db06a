      "message": "Suggestion: I would suggest removing the final modifier. There is no real benefit in adding it to every local variable in this class since the scope of the method is really limited and there is no risk of someone reassigning something to the variable. In this case in my opinon the final keywords pose more readability issues, than actually protect against something. It is your own code after all so you should trust yourself not to reuse the vars :)",
