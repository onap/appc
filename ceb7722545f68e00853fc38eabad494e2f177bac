      "message": "I kept looking at this and thinking there must be a better way to do this.  Finally figured out this could have been done using set operations, eliminating the middle loop.  Instead of looping through the values, just create a set that\u0027s a copy of entry1.getValue() and then removeAll(entry2.getValue()).  If the result is non-empty, then you know there\u0027s overlap.\n\nNevertheless, it\u0027s okay the way it\u0027s written.  Maybe next time.",
