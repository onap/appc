CONFIGURATION_STARTED=APPC0001I|\
  ECOMP Application Controller (APP-C) initialization started at {0}|\
  No resolution is required, this is an informational message|\
  The APP-C component configuration has been started because the component is being \
    initialized or loaded for the first time, or a new instance of the component is \
    being created.  This message indicates that the component is starting.

CONFIGURATION_CLEARED=APPC0002I|\
  All prior configuration has been cleared|\
  No resolution is required, this is an informational message|\
  The APP-C component is being started or restarted and any prior configuration \
    (if present), is cleared.  This is normal.

LOADING_CONFIGURATION_OVERRIDES=APPC0003I|\
  Loading configuration properties from file "{0}"|\
  No resolution is required, this is an informational message|\
  This message indicates that the configuration of the APP-C component was located \
    and is being loaded from the specified file.

LOADING_DEFAULTS=APPC0004I|\
  Configuration defaults loaded from resource file "{0}"|\
  No resolution is required, this is an informational message|\
  This is a normal indication that the default configuration settings were loaded \
    from the resource file.  The APP-C components load a default configuration first \
    so that all configuration values have valid default settings.  Any user configuation \
    that may be specified then overrides these defaults.

NO_DEFAULTS_FOUND=APPC0005E|\
  No default property resource "{0}" was found!|\
  This is an internal error.  Contact support.|\
  This is an internal error that indicates that the default resource property file \
    could not be located.  This is likely a packaging error and is indicative of \
    a construction problem.  Refer this to development or level 3 support for assistance.

PROPERTY_VALUE=APPC0006I|\
  Property "{0}" ="{1}"|\
  No resolution is required, this is an informational message|\
  This message is issued to show the value of configuration properties and is used to \
    debug start up of the component.

NO_OVERRIDE_PROPERTY_FILE_LOADED=APPC0007E|\
  No configuration file named [{0}] was found on the configuration search path [{1}]. \
    If a configuration file should have been loaded, check the file name and search \
    path specified.  APPC will proceed using the default values and command-line \
    overrides (if any).|\
  If a configuration file was expected, verify the file name and that it exists on \
    the search path for the configuration properties.  The search path defaults to \
    <em>&#36;{user.home},/opt/app/appc/etc,etc,../etc,/etc,.</em> and can be overridden \
    by specification of the property <em>org.openecomp.appc.bootstrap.path</em>.  The \
    property file name defaults to <em>appc.properties</em> and can also be \
    overridden by the <em>org.openecomp.appc.bootstrap.file</em> property.|\
  This message indicates that the bootstrap path was searched for the bootstrap \
    property file (a file that can be supplied to configure APPC) and that no file \
    with the specified name was found on any of the path elements of the path.

SEARCHING_CONFIGURATION_OVERRIDES=APPC0008I|\
  Searching path "{0}" for configuration settings "{1}"|\
  No resolution is required|\
  This message indicates that the specified path is being examined for a configuration \
    file of the indicated name.  The configuration file defaults to <em>appc.properties</em> \
    but can be overridden by specification of the <em>org.openecomp.appc.bootstrap.file</em> \
    property (using a command-line override, for example).  This message is intended to \
    assist in the debugging and analysis of configuration issues where the indicated \
    file may not be processed or found.  The path that is searched is a comma-delimited \
    list of directories and defaults to <em>&#36;{user.home},/opt/app/appc/etc,etc,../etc,/etc,.</em> \
    but can also be overridden by specification of the <em>org.openecomp.appc.bootstrap.path</em> \
    property.

LOADING_APPLICATION_OVERRIDES=APPC0009I|\
  Loading application-specific override properties|\
  No resolution required|\
  This message indicates that the APPC component was invoked as an embedded component \
    and that the caller has supplied an override property object.

NO_APPLICATION_OVERRIDES=APPC0010I|\
  No application-specific override properties were provided!|\
  No resolution required|\
  This message indicates that the APPC component was invoked as an embedded component \
    and that the caller has supplied an override property object, but that object was \
    empty.

MERGING_SYSTEM_PROPERTIES=APPC0011I|\
  Merging system properties into configuration|\
  No resolution is required|\
  This message indicates that the java virtual machine system properties are being \
    examined and merged into the APP-C component configuration.  This allows for command \
    line specification of any APP-C configuration property as a standard java define \
    JVM option (ex: -Dproperty=value).

SETTING_SPECIAL_PROPERTY=APPC0012I|\
  Setting property "{0}={1}" in system properties|\
  No resolution required.|\
  This message indicates that the specified property loaded from defaults, property \
    file overrides, application overrides, or command-line overrides is being placed \
    in the system (java virtual machine) properties object.  Some libraries that may \
    be integrated with APP-C (for example, DME2 or AFT libraries) may only look for \
    their properties in the system properties object.  This allows those components \
    to be configured from the APP-C configuration.

LOADING_RESOURCE_BUNDLE=APPC0013I|\
  Loading resource bundle "{0}"|\
  No resolution required|\
  This message indicates that the specified resource bundle is being loaded.

LOGGING_ALREADY_INITIALIZED=APPC0014W|\
  Logging has already been initialized, check the container logging definitions to ensure \
    they represent your desired logging configuration.|\
  If logging is configured incorrectly, move the definitions to the container or component \
    that first initialized logging.  If they are ok, no resolution is required.|\
  This message indicates that the logging environment already exists and has been configured.

SEARCHING_LOG_CONFIGURATION=APPC0015I|\
  Searching path "{0}" for log configuration file "{1}"|\
  No resolution is required|\
  This message indicates that the APP-C component configuration file specified a logging \
    configuration file and/or search path and the path is being searched.  This is used to \
    assist in debugging the configuration process.

LOADING_DEFAULT_LOG_CONFIGURATION=APPC0016I|\
  Loading default logging configuration from system resource file "{0}"|\
  No resolution is required|\
  A default logging configuration for the component is loaded from system resources to \
    ensure that a valid logging environment exists.  This is a normal message, and will \
    be followed by APPC0019I if a user-specified logging configuration overrides the \
    defaults.

NO_LOG_CONFIGURATION=APPC0017E|\
  No log configuration could be found or defaulted!|\
  A valid logging configuration cannot be found, and no default configuration resource \
    was loaded.  This is likely a packaging issue and should be referred to development \
    or level 3 support for assistance.|\
  This is an internal error.

UNSUPPORTED_LOGGING_FRAMEWORK=APPC0018E|\
  An unsupported logging framework is bound to SLF4J.  Only Logback or Log4J are supported.|\
  This is a compatibility error with logging frameworks used in the application environment \
    and should be referred to development or level 3 support for assistance.|\
  This is an internal error.

LOADING_LOG_CONFIGURATION=APPC0019I|\
  Loading logging configuration from file "{0}"|\
  No resolution is required|\
  The specified logging configuration is being loaded.

UNKNOWN_PROVIDER=APPC0020E|\
  Provider {0} cannot be found or cannot be resolved to one of the known providers, [{1}].|\
  Specify the name of a valid provider. The IAAS adapter contains a set of providers \
    that are defined.  Each of these providers is assigned a logical name.  The call \
    to the IAAS adapter must specify the name of the provider that is desired.  This \
    could be the result of an incorrect call, or the IAAS adapter configuration is \
    wrong.|\
  The APP-C IAAS adapter is being called to request a service on a specific provider, but \
    the name of the provider cannot be found in the list of defined providers.  This may \
    be an error in the directed graph that contains the call to the IAAS adapter, or it \
    may be an error in the request, or the configuration of the IAAS adapter may need \
    to be updated.

SERVER_STATE_CHANGE_TIMEOUT=APPC0021E|\
  Server name "{0}" with id "{1}" in tenant "{2}" and region "{3}" did not change state \
    within the alloted time. Current state is "{4}" and the desired state(s) are "{5}"|\
  This is likely a provider issue.  If the provider is OpenStack, check the virtual \
    machine on the horizon dashboard.  If the machine is in an invalid state, you may \
    need to contact Openstack support.  The exact mechanisms for recovery of a machine \
    in an invalid state are varied and will be different from provider to provider.|\
  This message indicates that the IAAS adapter has performed some requested action \
    on the specified server (virtual machine) but the server did not enter a valid \
    state (running, stopped, etc) within the timeout period.  The last state (current state) \
    is shown, as well as the state that was expected.  The servers name, UUID, containing \
    tenant, and region are shown so that the correct provider can be examined.

SERVER_DELETED=APPC0022E|\
  Server name "{0}" with id "{1}" in tenant "{2}" has a state of deleted and cannot be {3}.|\
  The specified server has been deleted on the provider.  This is likely an incorrect \
    request.  Make sure that you are specifying the correct server ID/name, provider, \
    and region.  If the self-link URL is used, make sure that the correct server resource \
    is specified.  If the machine was correct, recreate or rebuild the machine to make \
    it usable.  Correct the request.|\
  This message indicates that the server specified was found to have been deleted in the \
    target provider and that the requested action cannot be performed.  This may be caused \
    by several things:\
    <ol>\
      <li>The UUID of the server is wrong and specifies a machine that no longer exists</li>\
      <li>The machine was deleted by a different process or request</li>\
      <li>The wrong provider was requested</li>\
      <li>The request was out-of-order</li>\
    </ol>

UNKNOWN_SERVER_STATE=APPC0023E|\
  Server name "{0}" with id "{1}" in tenant "{2}" has an unknown state of "{3}".|\
  Check the machine to determine the state of the machine.  Correct that state to a valid \
    state if possible.  This may also be caused by an internal error in the PAL (Provider \
    Abstraction Layer) used by the IAAS if a new state definition has been added to the \
    provider (such as a new version or the installation of an unknown or unsupported \
    extension).  If the machine's state is valid, refer this error to development or \
    level 3 support for assistance.|\
  This message indicates that a request was made to the IAAS adapter to take some action \
    on the specified virtual machine, but the machine was found to be in a state that \
    prevents that action from being performed.

  Correct the server URL|\
  The requested server, identified by its self link URL, could not be found in the provider

SERVER_OPERATION_EXCEPTION=APPC0044E|\
  Exception {0} was caught attempting {1} of server [{2}] on tenant [{3}]|\
  Contact support for assistance|\
  An exception was caught while trying to perform the indicated operation on the server. The \
    exception may yield more information about the cause of the error.  This may be because \
    of access security, or the server is in an invalid state, or any number of reasons.  This \
    message should be referred to support for assistance.


STACK_NOT_FOUND=APPC0043E|\
  No stack found in provider with self-link URL [{0}]|\
  Correct the server URL|\
  The requested stack, identified by its self link URL, could not be found in the provider

STACK_OPERATION_EXCEPTION=APPC0044E|\
  Exception {0} was caught attempting {1} of server [{2}] on tenant [{3}]|\
  Contact support for assistance|\
  An exception was caught while trying to perform the indicated operation on the stack. The \
    exception may yield more information about the cause of the error.  This may be because \
    of access security, or the stack is in an invalid state, or any number of reasons.  This \
    message should be referred to support for assistance.

MISSING_REQUIRED_PROPERTIES=APPC0045E|\
  One or more properties for [{0}] are missing, null, or empty.  They are:|\
  A request to execute the adapter indicated was made from a directed graph, but the properties \
    of the request that are required by the adapter are missing or do not have a value.  Correct \
    the directed graph to supply the missing properties.|\
  The specified properties for the indicated adapter operation are invalid or missing.

SERVER_ERROR_STATE=APPC0046E|\
  The server [{0}] (id={1}) in tenant {2} is in error state, {3} is not allowed|\
  Destroy and recreate the instance|\
  A request to restart or rebuild a server in an error state was received, but those operations \
    are not allowed on a server in this state.  OpenStack only allows a deletion of a server \
    that is in the error state.

IMAGE_NOT_FOUND=APPC0047E|\
  The image {0} could not be located for {1}.|\
  The image indicated could not be found.  If the operation being requested is a rebuild of \
    a server, then there is no action that can be taken other than to destroy the server and \
    rebuild it using an image that exists.|\
  This is likely caused by an image being deleted after it was used to build a server.  If the \
    request is for a server rebuild, then the image used to create the server was later deleted \
    and no longer exists.  The server cannot be rebuilt, because the image doesnt exist. \
    The server must be deleted and reconstructed using a valid, existing image.

STATE_CHANGE_TIMEOUT=APPC0048E|\

  The resource indicated (by name and id) was expected to change it's state (status) to one of the \
    indicated expected states within a specified timeout but the resource did not complete the \
    state change.  It's current state is also shown. This can be caused by any number of factors \
    but is normally a problem or conflict within the IaaS provider (OpenStack).

STATE_CHANGE_EXCEPTION=APPC0049E|\
  Exception {0} waiting for {1} with name {2} (and id {3}) to reach one of {4} states, current state is {5}\n\
    cause={6}|\
  Recover the resource in whatever means is appropriate|\
  The resource indicated (by name and id) was expected to change it's state (status) to one of the \
    indicated expected states within a specified timeout but the resource did not complete the \
    state change.  It's current state is also shown. This can be caused by any number of factors \
    but is normally a problem or conflict within the IaaS provider (OpenStack).

    retrying in {5} seconds, attempt {6} of {7}.|\
  The connection to the provider could not be obtained for the indicated reason.  The application \
    controller will retry the attempt to connect to the provider a maximum number of times.  The \
    message contains the amount of time the system will wait to retry the connection, and the \
    current attempt and the maximum number of attempts.|\
  Correct the cause of the connection failure as indicated by the reason.

CONNECTION_FAILED=APPC0055E|\
 Connection to provider {0} at service {1} failed after all retry attempts.|\
 The connection to the named provider at the indicated service URL cannot be opened.  All \
   retries have been exhausted.  The application controller is giving up on the connection and will \
   fail the request.|\
 Correct the cause of the connection failure as indicated by the reason(s) in previous APPC0054E \
   messages.

STOPPING_SERVER=APPC0056I|\

  Server {0} (id {1}) failed to rebuild, reason {2}|\
  The server rebuild failed for the indicated reason. Correct the cause of the failure and \
    rerun, if applicable.|\
  The adapter has attempted to rebuild the indicated server but the rebuild request has \
    been failed by the provider for some reason.  The reason returned by the provider is \
    included in the message.

PARAMETER_IS_MISSING=APPC0058E|\
  Application {0} graph {1} response did not set the {2} parameter. This parameter is \
    required for synchronization with the controller. Absence of this parameter is assumed \
    to be a failure. Please correct the DG.|\
  The indicated directed graph was called from the application controller but when the \
    graph returned the indicated property was not defined in the return parameters.  The \
    controller requires that property to be defined and set to a value that is used to \
    inform the controller of the outcome of operations in the graph.  Failure to set \
    the required parameter is assumed to be a failure regardless if the graph actually \
    succeeded or not.|\
  Correct the DG to set the specified parameter to a value that is expected and understood \
    by the controller.

PARAMETER_NOT_NUMERIC=APPC0059E|\
  Application {0} graph {1} did not set parameter {2} to a valid numeric value ({3}). \
    Please correct the DG.|\
  The indicated directed graph was called by the application controller and the graph \
    did set the specified property, however the property is not a valid numeric \
    value.  The parameter is used to convey a numeric quantity and the controller \
    cannot convert the value specified to a number. |\
  Correct the DG.

DG_FAILED_RESPONSE=APPC0060E|\
  Application {0} graph {1} completed with failure: error code = {2}, message = {3}|\
  The directed graph indicated was called by the application controller and when \
    the graph returned, an error code was set indicating that the graph failed. This \
    is a message that echoes the results of the graph, and shows the returned error \
    code and message.|\
  Correct the cause of the error.

EXCEPTION_CALLING_DG=APPC0061E|\
  Application {0} received exception {1} attempting to call graph {2}, exception \
    message = {3}|\
  The application controller attempted to call the service logic interpreter (SLI) \
    to execute the indicated graph, but an exception was caught.  The class of the \
    exception is shown, as is the message associated with the exception.  An \
    abbreviated stack trace is also displayed to provide information as to the \
    state of the thread at the time of the exception.|\
  Correct the cause of the exception and rerun.

GRAPH_NOT_FOUND=APPC0062E|\
  Application {0} was unable to locate graph {1}|\
  The application controller attempted to call the service logic interpreter (SLI) \
    to execute the specified graph but the graph does not exist in the SLI database.|\
  Correct the database and install the correct graph.

DEBUG_GRAPH_RESPONSE_HEADER=APPC0063D|\
  Application {0} graph {1} responded with {2} properties|\
  This is a debugging message that is output immediately after the call to the \
    directed graph and before any processing is performed to determine the success \
    or failure of that call.  The heading is output prior to dumping all the parameters \
    that were returned by the graph.|\
  No recovery action is required.

DEBUG_GRAPH_RESPONSE_DETAIL=APPC0064D|\
  {0}:{1} - {2} = {3}|\
  This is a debugging message that is output immediately after the call to the \
    directed graph and before any processing is performed to determine the success \
    or failure of that call.  This message is repeated for each parameter that \
    exists in the return context from the graph.|\
  No recovery action is required.

INVALID_REQUIRED_PROPERTY=APPC0065E|\
  Application {0} request "{1}" was supplied a property "{2}" with the value "{3}" \
    that does not meet the required form(s):|\
  This message indicates that the specified requested operation was passed the \
    specific property named and the property value did not meet the expected \
    format requirements.  For example, if the property is expected to be a \
    numeric quantity and it contains alphabetic characters, or if it is expected \
    to be a URL and it is not valid.  The message also contains a list of one \
    or more regular expressions that were used to validate the input, and which \
    supply the syntax required for the property.|\
  Correct the property and retry.

MIGRATING_SERVER=APPC066I|\
