Perhaps it would be better to create three transaction objects, two with the same values and one with one value that\u0027s slightly different (\u0027some_action\u0027 -\u003e \u0027some_actioo\u0027).  Then verify that the hashcodes are the same for the two equal objects, and different for the different object",
